## Background Context
Monitoring and managing water quality is essential for environmental sustainability and public health. However, water quality varies significantly across different locations and times, complicating resource management. 

Key challenges addressed in this project include:
- Understanding spatial and temporal variations in water quality.
- Identifying environmental factors affecting water quality indicators such as pH, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen.
- Developing predictive models for effective forecasting and pollution mitigation.
